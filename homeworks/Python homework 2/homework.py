# Homework tasks:
# *Input 3 floats from console, calculate their sum and print result
# float_number1 = float(input('Please write number in float type: '))
# float_number2 = float(input('Please write number in float type: '))
# summary = float_number1 + float_number2
# print('this is summary: ', summary)


# *Input 2 integers from console, calculate their division as integer and print the result
# value1 = int(input('Please input first value: '))
# value2 = int(input('Please input second value: '))
# div = value1 / value2
# print('this is division: ', div)


# *Input 2 numbers from console and check if both of them are positive
# value1 = int(input('Please input first value: '))
# value2 = int(input('Please input second value: '))
#
# if value1 > 0 and value2 > 0:
#     print('both are positive')
# else:
#     print('one is negative')

# *Ask user to input number from console and check if it contains any symbols
# value1 = input('Please input number: ')
# print('your input is: ', type(value1))


# *Read an integer from console and if it is positive calculate itâ€™s square root
# import math
# value1 = int(input('write an integer: '))
# if value1 > 0:
#     print('your inputed value\'s square is: ', math.sqrt(value1))

# *Input 2 numbers from console (1-st is integer, 2-nd float), calculate their sum and concatenation
# value1 = input('please input an integer: ')
# value2 = input('please input an float: ')
# summary = int(value1) + float(value2)
# concat = value1 + value2
# print('this is sum: ', summary)
# print('this is : concatenation', concat)


# *Generate a random number from 1 to 100 and check if the number is greater than 15 and less than 36
# import random
# rand_number = random.randint(1, 100)
# if rand_number > 15 and rand_number < 36:
#     print('Number is greater than 15 and less than 36, number is: ', rand_number)
# else:
#     print('Number isn\'t greater than 15 and less than 36, number is: ', rand_number)

# *Create 2 modules: 1. stores some attributes about a room (color, number, etc.); 2. makes some operations on attributes of first module
# import about
# print('Room\'s color is: ', about.color)
# print('Room\'s number is: ', about.number)
# print('Room\'s sofa\s number is: ', about.sofa)
# print('Room\'s bathroom\'s number is: ', about.bathroom)
