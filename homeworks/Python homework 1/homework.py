# *Write program for calculating (a+b)^2 for some a and b

# a = 6
# b = 5
# c = (a+b)*2
# print(c)

# *Write following program: define a, b and c storing some numbers, calculate and print their sum, multiplication, division, etc.


# firstValue = int(input('Please input a first value\n'))
# secondValue = int(input('Please input a second value\n'))
# thirdValue = int(input('Please input a third value\n'))

# summ = firstValue + secondValue + thirdValue
# multiplication = firstValue * secondValue * thirdValue
# division = firstValue / secondValue / thirdValue
# sub = firstValue - secondValue - thirdValue
#
# print('The sub is: ' + str(summ))
# print('The multiplication is: ' + str(multiplication))
# print('The division is: ' + str(division))
# print('The sub is: ' + str(sub))
